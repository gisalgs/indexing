    Circular range search for points within a radius of r around p

    Input
      t: node of a point k-D tree
      p: a Point object around which query is performed
      r: circle radius around p
      found: a list to hold points found, declared outside
      depth: the current depth on the k-D tree, mainly used internally

    Output
      This function does not return any values. However, all the points
      found during the query process will be appended to list found.
