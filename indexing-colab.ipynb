    "An **algorithm** is a process that contains a set of well designed steps for calculation. For example, we can design a process to tell that, given any integer, what is the next odd number. The word algorithm is from latin _algorismus_, which is from _al-Khwa-rizmī_, a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. There are two aspects to evaluate an algorithm: its **correctness** and **time complexity**. We focus on the latter here. Time complexity is also called running time, though the term \"running\" is not accurate because we are not really talking about how the algorithm actually runs but in theory how the computation grows with the problem size. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the fundamental concepts of time complexity. There will be four short videos associated this tutorial. They are listed below and will also be referred to in the tutorial. \n",

    "A commonly used type of algorithms is **search**. For example, if we have a database of cities, we may want to find if a city is in the database so that we can pull information for that city. Search comes in different shapes and here we are going to generalize such tasks as searching for one dimensional information as represented using a series of numbers. These numbers can be considered as the IDs of some entities. In later part of this module we will explore how multiple dimensions in the data (such as points in spatial data) can be utilized for search. \n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest form of search is called **linear search**, which is a process that goes through all the items in our data and the search will stop when we either find the item we are searching for or we reach the end of all the items. Let us assume we have a list of numbers named `nums` (e.g., `nums = [1, 2, 9, 12, 15, 29, 32, 91, 4, 11]` or `num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`) and we want to find if number `j` is in the list. The following is the linear search algorithm:\n",

    "***\n",

    "```\n",

    "To understand the time complexity of linear search, let's assume\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting a number (or point) out of the list takes $c_1$ time (line 1)\n",
    "* Comparing if two numbers (points) are the same takes $c_2$ time (line 2)\n",
    "* Returning the result takes $c_3$ time (line 3)\n",
    "* $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ are constants\n",
    "* There are $n$ numbers (points) in the list\n",

    "What is the total time needed for the above linear search algorithm? Here are some points to think about:\n",

    "* There are best cases and worst cases\n",
    "* In the worst case scenario, $c_1$ and $c_2$ will be run up to $n$ times, and $c_3$ will be run once\n",
    "* Therefore the total time is $c1 \\times n + c2 \\times n + c3$\n",
    "* In average, we will take $c1 \\times n/2 + c2 \\times n/2 + c3$, which can be generalized as $(n \\times b + c)$, where $b = (c1+c2)/2$\n",

    "We don't really care much about $b$ and $c$ -- they are constant and are always relatively small. But the value of n tells how running time **grows** with the data. We use a growth function to tell the running time. More specifically, if we know there is a definitive upper bound of the running time, we use a **Big-O** notation to denote the growth. In the case of the linear search algorithm, we have a running time of $O(n)$. The above algorithm is called **linear search** for a reason: the time used is linear to the size of input. \n",

    "In order to improve the \"user experience\" when we conduct the experiments, we want to have a nice way of showing the progress: it can be stressful to test a million iterations without knowing where we are and how long we have to wait. We do this with a progress bar. There are many ways to make a progress bar in Python interactive environment (including this one) and some of them can be found at [this stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3160699/python-progress-bar). But we only need a very simple one without having to involve too complicated techniques. We use a special character `'\\r'` that forces the cursor to move to the beginning of each line (so called carriage return) when we use the `print` function. [This github page](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/166) suggests using the carriage return at the beginning of the string instead of in the end character. We will need to make sure the next string to print is at least as long as the previous one. Otherwise, part of the previous print will remain on screen because it is not covered by the new one. Sometimes we can add some spaces at the end to make sure nothing noticeable is shown."

But we are not going to get into too this here (there is a lot of discussion on this on the web). Instead, let's just take the worse case (the numbers are reshuffled and sorted) and see if we can devise a new search mechanism like we use the dictionary: we start from somewhere in the middle. With the help of code, we can start exactly at the middle. If the number to find is greater than the one in the middle, we only need to search for the half where all is smaller than the target.

A **tree** contains multiple **nodes** where each node can have **child nodes** and **parent nodes**, except for the **root** node that does not have parent nodes and **leaf nodes** that do not have child nodes. The linkages between nodes are called the **edges**. The root serves as the access point to the entire tree. The tree illustrated above represents the sequence of numbers ranging from 1 to 7 in a **binary** fashion where each node can have up to two child nodes, and for each given node, the number that is smaller will be placed on the left child node and otherwise on the right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of trees is that they are structured so that we can conduct a **divide-and-conquer** approach to searching for information. Using a binary tree for example we can perform a **binary search** by excluding the nodes on one side of each node (starting at the root) and therefore expedite the search process. However, the trees for the same data can be constructed differently and one way to measure their difference is to count the number of edges one has to pass from the root to the leaf nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "On of the interesting issues of using a tree structure is that the same data (numbers here) can be used to construct different trees, and here are two examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which tree is \"better\" then? To answer this question, we need to introduce a few terminologies. The **depth** of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root is 0. There is at least a leaf node on the tree that has the deepest (with the highest number of edges) from the root, and we call this depth the **height** of the tree. The ideas of depth and height can also be looked at from the perspective of each node (we just pretend the node is the root and concentrate on all the child nodes from that node). This is what we call a **subtree**, formed by a node and all its child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every node on a tree has two subtrees, left and right. This leads to the definition of a **balanced tree**: a tree where the difference in the heights of the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. A wordier way to say the same, but using the term depth, is this: a balanced tree is a tree where the difference in the depths of the deepest leaf nodes in the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. To this definition (there are different definitions too), the above two tree are not balanced, but the first tree is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of numbers, we can build a binary tree from scratch. We use the first number as the root and the next number will be the left child node of the root if it is smaller than the toot, or the right if greater. The process continues until all numbers are included in the tree. [**This video**](https://mediasite.osu.edu/Mediasite/Play/1d687e1028db46b8a91ba03907469b3d1d) explains the process."

Each **node** has three members: data that stores whatever information we want to store for the tree, and the left and right child nodes of each node. We can store \"whatever\" information in the data member, but we have an important assumption: we must be able to conduct **comparison** between such data. Numbers are naturally in the category because we know how to compare them. For other type of data, we must override the logic operators to make sure comparison can be done (see an example of the Point class we discussed in the previous section of this class).\n",

With that, we discuss the most important operation for trees: insertion. There are different ways to insert a node. For example, we can insert a new node to between two nodes, or we can always insert child nodes to leaf nodes. We use the latter approach here. To do so, however, we will need to be able to find the appropriate leaf node. We write a function called **search_bt** for this purpose. This is a **recursive** function since we can continuously call this function until we reach a leaf node.\n",

The latter case is useful when we try to decide where to put a new node — it must be the node that is the immediate parent node of the new node.\n",

If the difference between the heights of all leaf nodes is no more than 1, we say the tree is **balanced**. A perfectly balanced tree with a height of $H$ will be able to hold a total of $2^0 +2^1 +2^2 +...+2^H = 2^{H+1}−1$ items.
